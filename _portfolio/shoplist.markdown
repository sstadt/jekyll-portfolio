{:.intro}
The Shoplist app provides an easy way to share and sync lists between multiple users leveraging Socket.io integration in Sails.js to provide real time updates while using the app.

{:.tech-stack}
 - Grunt
 - Sails.js
 - Foundation
 - SASS
 - Knockout.js
 - MongoDB

The app was built at a time when current apps either didn't meet the needs of our household or were too feature-heavy. I took this as an opportunity to start working with front end frameworks, and I immediately took a liking to the component style of Knockout.js.

Knockout.js would later become my gateway drug to more modern frameworks like Vue.js.
