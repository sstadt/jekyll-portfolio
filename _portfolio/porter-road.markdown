{:.intro}
Porter Road was a pre-existing build that I became the primary developer on fairly early on while working at BVA Commerce. The most prominent project I worked on was the integration with ReCharge for subscriptions, which would become the company's primary source of revenue.

 - Shopify
 - Liquid
 - jQuery
 - SCSS

For the ReCharge integration on Porter Road, we built a custom funnel that guided users into the most appropriate subscription model based on their diet and expected recurring needs. Ultimately the functionality would be integrated on the PDP to allow for a more organic buy once or subscribe subscription flow.
