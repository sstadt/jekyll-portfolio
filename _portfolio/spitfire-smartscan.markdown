{:.intro}
Spitfire Smartscan is a quiz application that allows your team to assess your team's communication skills and get feedback on how you can improve. I worked on this project during my tenure with Solid Interactive.

{:.tech-stack}
 - Grunt
 - Node.js
 - Foundation
 - SASS
 - MongoDB

This application was my first introduction with working with Node.js. It was build on the Grasshopper framework, and gave me the opportunity to start learning to work with promises and the differences between SWL and NoSQL databases.
