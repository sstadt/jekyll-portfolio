{:.intro}
Homesick was a pre-existing site that got a lot of love and upgrades during my time at WIN Brands. Consistently a top performer among the company portfolio, Homesick may have been the most recognizable brand I worked on at WIN.

Throughout my stewardship of the code I upgraded several areas of the site with new functionality including: PDP overall layout, landing page architecture, sidecart implementation, and navigation implementation.

The primary goal was always to maintain the look and feel of the site, but each upgrade represented an effort to ensure the customer had a better expereince checking out. From the full sidecart rebuilt that included gitwrap options and targeted upsells, to extensive A/B testing aimed at increasing conversion rate, Homesick underwent many extensive renovations.
