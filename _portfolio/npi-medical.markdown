{:.intro}
NPI Medical is a WordPress driven site that I worked on during my tenure at Solid Interactive.

{:.tech-stack}
 - Grunt
 - WordPress
 - Foundation
 - SASS
 - jQuery

For this site build I focused on code reusability and optimizations. Post type creation and configuration pages were automated with a custom built PostType class that allowed me to pass in a much slimmer JSON config to fully register a post type.
