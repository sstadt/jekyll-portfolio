{:.intro}
Inline Plastics is a WordPress driven site that I worked on during my tenure at Solid Interactive.

{:.tech-stack}
 - Grunt
 - WordPress
 - Foundation
 - SASS
 - jQuery

For this site the team build out a multi data source product solution that incorporated uploadable CSV product lists into the WordPress admin. This allowed site administrators to upload an entire product catalog to WordPress at once, cutting back on the amount or time Inline Plastics needed to devote to site administration.
