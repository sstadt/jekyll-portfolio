{:.intro}
Qalo.com was my first assignment, and first build, for WIN Brands Group. I was tasked with creating a website that would work on a standard Shopify theme, have code that could later be ported to a headless storefront, and was able to support complex customizations on a variety of projects. The resulting project was fast and highly configurable.

 - Shopify
 - Liquid
 - Vue.js
 - Vuex
 - SCSS

The project took advantage of Shopify snippets to funnel section and theme settings into a Vuex data store, rendering components that would then display the content on the site. With all that data accessible by the Vue app, it was relatively straight forward to build out even the most complicated features.

In the end, we ended up with an easily maintainable customizer that allowed the product team to quickly and easily add new customizable products with multiple lines of text, various types of placement on preview images, and customized engraving colors. All of this while attaching the data to line items in a way that met Shopify requirements and get the in-house customization fulfillment team happy!
