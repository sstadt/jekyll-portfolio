{:.intro}
Forge UI is a lightweight collection of simple Vue.js components aimed as flexibility and customization. The component list is currently small, but growing. By maintaining a simple and customizable set of basic UI functionality, Forge UI aims to clear out the grunt work of modern ui building without cluttering the source files with unused niche components.

Forge UI is one of my ongoing pet projects. I've learned a lot from using frameworks like Foundation and Bootstrap, and there's a special place in my heart for them. Nowadays, though, I typically only need a set of basic functionality to be repeated. Most application components tend to be custom, and I've increasingly grown to shy away from a full front end framework when I really only want a grid system and some basic modals, alerts, and form validation.

Currently, Forge UI integrates with Foundation 6 for much of it's base styling, but moving forward this requirement will be phased out in favor of a slimmer set of CSS components built for flexbox and the incoming CSS grid that I'm developed while building the [Star Wars Game Table](/portfolio/game-table).
