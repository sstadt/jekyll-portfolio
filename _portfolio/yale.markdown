{:.intro}
The Yale Repertory Theatre site as an employee of [L2 Interactive](http://www.lynch2.com/). This was a fun site to build being given design elements that presented some unique CSS challenges.

{:.tech-stack}
 - Gulp
 - LESS
 - ES6

This was also the first project at the company where accessibility standards were being implemented. I was able to work with the client and designers to find solutions for design and content that allowed the site to meet WCAG AA accessibility standards.
