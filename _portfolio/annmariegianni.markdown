{:.intro}
Ann Marie Skin Care was a pre-existing site that got a lot of love and upgrades during my time at BVA Commerce. Ann Marie was a long time client of BVA by the time I had been brought on, and for over a year I had been assigned as the primary developer.

Throughout my stewardship of the code I upgraded several areas of the site with new functionality including: Home page redesign, PDP redesign, collection page redesign, sidecart implementation, and navigation implementation.

Ann Marie went through a bit-by-bit redesign over the course of a year (amidst ongoing work on other project). Bit by bit, though, we were able to replace all the major portions of the site while maintaining the brand's distinctive appearance.
