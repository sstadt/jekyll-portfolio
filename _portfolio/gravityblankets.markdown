{:.intro}
Gravity Blankets represents a desire to simplify and optimize workflow and development for the Shopify platform. The site was built with the intention of being reused as a template for future sites, so jQuery was used to keep the tech stack as slim and widely usable as possible.

The site capitalized on the new Shopify 2.0 themes, using JSON templates to speed up new page creations and maximize reuse of sections and snippets. Reusable snippets for product forms were created that could be used throughout the site, irrespective of design needs. Paired with UI control snippets that presented different formats while maintaining uniform functionality under the hood, features like the Sidecart, Quick Add (collections), and Product Form (PDP) run on the same "add to card" code, making it fast and easy to convert users regardless of what page they land on.

Ultimately the site maximized reuse of code to prevent the bloating that typically comes from 3rd parties injecting unpredictable versions of jQuery, and the extra load of adding a monolithic framework for sites that operate largely in a very standardized way.
