{:.intro}
Oofos was a mlestone build at BVA Commerce, as I was tasked with more than just building a new site for this project. With general discontentment over the process for building sites at BVA, my manager tasked me with putting together Oofos as a template for future site builds. Since the site included the vast majority of standard functionality we were adding to new storefronts at the time, Oofos would be used again and again in the coming years to jump start development on new projects.

 - Shopify
 - Liquid
 - Vue.js
 - Vuex
 - SCSS

As a first step for this project, we used Vue.js and Vuex for the build since our developers were all longing to use more modern tooling and Vue was the predominant skillset in the Columbus office. We allowed Vue to wrap the entire site, and then added tooling to support 3rd party script additions (common practice for 4rd party Shopify apps). This allowed out snippets and sections to render Vue components that the app would fully take over for rendering while not missing out on any of the popular 3rd party functionality provided by apps.

In the end, the template was used to bootstrap all new Shopify builds in the Columbus office for the remainder of my tenure at the company. This implementation reduced time to deliver new projects by 40%, making the company thousands of dollars from increased efficiency over the years.
