{:.intro}
Homage was a pre-existing Shopify built with an incredibly complex Vue and Vuex architecture. Instead of maintaining a single Vuex data store the entire site could use, it had been built to have separate independent data stores that were in desperate need of unification.

Homage was not originally the easiest site to love. It had been passed from developer to developer over the years, and it showed as much in it's bones. When the torch was passed down to me, however, it became apparent that the site needed an overhaul. Bit by bit those bones were stitched together and unified over time, ensuring their unchecked growth and site stability would continue unabated.
